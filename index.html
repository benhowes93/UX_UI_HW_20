        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p class="lead">Few industries were more impacted by the global pandemic of COVID-19 than was the travel and tourism industry.Travelers have been apprehensive to book trips as they adjust to the new realities brought about by the pandemic.</p>
        <hr class="my-4">
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>We hope to locate and address the primary anxieties that are preventing prospective travelers from booking trips so that our eventual users can feel confident that they will have a safe, affordable and fun vacation.

          <p class="lead">The global pandemic of COVID-19 has forced travelers to consider factors that they had not previously had to consider. The inability to access and difficulty in processing this information leads prospective travelers to indefinitely put off vacations until they believe that they face an acceptable level of risk.Â 
            <br>
            How might we help travelers process relevant COVID-19 information while helping them organize required travel documentation?

        Our objective was to test the users ability to sign up for the app and purchase a trip. In order to achieve this, we had users complete the following tasks:
        <br>
        1) making a profile
        <br>
        2) adding a credit card
        <br>
        3) purchasing a vacation.</p>

      <h1 class="display-4">Final Thoughts</h1>
      <p class="lead">We found that users will be willing to resume pre-pandemic travel habits if they feel that the COVID associated risks are low. Addressing their specific COVID associated concerns is essential to restoring their confidence.
        Our challenge will be to continue to iterate the survey questions so that they can capture the user concerns as accurately as possible, and base travel recommendations off of that profile.
        However, we have to also ensure that the onboarding process does not become to lengthy, as our competitors all have very quick sign-up/onboarding processes.
        In short, we have to ensure that users can see the value of taking the extra time in building their profile.
